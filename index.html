						We are an upcoming roleplaying server for both San Andreas Multiplayer and Rage Multiplayer with the intent of creating an interconnected server where players are freely able to move inbetween different games while keeping the same characters, items and statistics.
					</p>
					<p>
						We truly do our best in order to reflect the name we have chosen for our server. We try to be completely transparent about what we're working on and what our goals are. We try to involve players into the decision-making process to a very high degree, and strive to provide a truly open world in which anything is possible and can be influenced by those who live in it.
					</p>
					<p>
						We, however, do not have any plans for making this project open-source, and at this moment, do not have an estimated time until launch.
